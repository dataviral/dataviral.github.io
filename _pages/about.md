I am a recent graduate from Carnegie Mellon University's Language Technologies Institute. My major pertrained to Data Science with a specialization in Analytics. My research interest is aligned with developing Machine Learning algorithms to help extract insights from large-scale multimedia data. While at CMU I have worked on diverse projects in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. My past research porject can be found here [https://dataviral.github.io/teaching/](https://dataviral.github.io/teaching/)

Spring 2021: Research Assistant at the Advanced Agent Robotics Technology (AART) Lab  in the Robotics Intitue @ CMU. 
- Designed an environment agnostic, modular, autonomous agent capable of exploring, describing and communicating information about its surroundings while operating in a bandwidth constrained scenario
- Integrated a Natural Language Understanding (NLU) module within an autonomous agent to enable human assisted navigation along with ability to perform sentence classification and visual question answering

December 2020: Successfully completed Graduation from CMU's Language Technologies Institute with a Master's degree in Computational Data Science.

Fall 2020: Research Assistant at the Advanced Agent Robotics Technology (AART) Lab  in the Robotics Intitue @ CMU.

Summer 2020: Ongoing Capstone research project aimed at developing an approach for visual dialog-based navigation of an autonomous agent in urban search and rescue scenario.

Spring 2020: Part of a research project aimed at developing a semi-supervised approach for classifying macromolecular structures present in Cryo-ET generated Subtomograms.
